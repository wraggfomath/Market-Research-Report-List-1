<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Solenoid Valves Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct-acting Type</li><li>Sub-step Direct-acting Type</li><li>Pilot-type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The solenoid valves market includes three main types: direct-acting, sub-step direct-acting, and pilot-type. Direct-acting solenoid valves operate independently, using a solenoid to directly move the valve mechanism. Sub-step direct-acting valves improve precision by allowing incremental control through multiple solenoid states. Pilot-type solenoid valves use a small solenoid to control a larger valve, offering efficient operation in high-flow applications. Each type caters to specific industry needs, from basic fluid control to applications requiring high precision and responsiveness.</p></p>
