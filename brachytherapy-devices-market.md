<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Brachytherapy Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>High Dose Rate Brachytherapy</li><li>Low Dose Rate Brachytherapy</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Brachytherapy devices are classified into two primary types based on the dose rate of radiation delivery. High Dose Rate (HDR) Brachytherapy involves the temporary placement of radioactive sources, delivering intense radiation over a short period, often used for localized tumors. In contrast, Low Dose Rate (LDR) Brachytherapy involves the permanent placement of radioactive materials that release radiation at a lower rate over an extended duration, suitable for conditions like prostate cancer. Both methods aim to maximize tumor targeting while minimizing damage to surrounding healthy tissue.</p></p>
