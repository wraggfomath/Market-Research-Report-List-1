<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Juicer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Tradtional Juice Extractor</li><li>Slow Juicer</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The juicer market comprises two main types: traditional juice extractors and slow juicers. Traditional juice extractors, often centrifugal, use high-speed blades to quickly extract juice, resulting in a frothy texture and shorter shelf life. In contrast, slow juicers, or masticating juicers, operate at lower speeds, crushing fruits and vegetables to maximize nutrient retention and deliver a smoother juice with a longer shelf life. Both types cater to different consumer preferences for health benefits, flavor, and convenience.</p></p>
